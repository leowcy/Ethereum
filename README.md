# Ethereum

Solidity is the language to write Smart Contract on the Ethereum.

This phonebook project includes: Solidity + Truffle + Ganache + Web3 + ExpressJS/RESTfulAPI + ReactJS(UI)

It is a fullstack project from the Front to the Back end. 

Right here we build a sample Phonebook as a example. Phonebook includes Find the PeopleInfo, Add people to phonebook, Delete the Poeple and Count the people number on the phonebook.

1.  Create a Phonebook Smart Contract in Solidity v0.5.3. You can test your SC on the remix website.
2.  Truffle Init command to create a Truffle Network. Move you SC here. Try Truffle Compile to get the Build folder. Create a file to depoly your SC to the Network.
3.  Use Ganache to deploy your SC. Use the Port and UserID on Ganache and change the truffle-config file to this.
4.  Truffle migrate to Migrate your SC to the Ganache network.
5.  Use Web3.js to call the function on your SC to test your SC.
6.  Install ExpressJS to your root folder and Write the RESTful API for you SC. Include Route/Controller/App/Index files.
7.  NPM RUN DEV to run your ExpressJS file. Use POSTMAN to test the GET/POST/DELETE function.
8.  Create-react-app to create a ReactJS for your folder to build the UI. Change the function to your SC function. And final you can test on yout http://Localhost:Port.

All above require: NPM/NODEMON/JOSNFILE/Solidity/Truffle/Ganache/Web3/Express/.... Just install your missing requirements.
